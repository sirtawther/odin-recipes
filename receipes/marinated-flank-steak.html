    <h1>Marinated Flank Steak</h1>
    <p>A great flank steak marinade like this one is important if you want a tender, juicy, flavorful steak. Make sure you marinate your flank steak for at least 2 hours for best results or longer if you have time. This wonderful quick and easy recipe also works great when the steak is sliced and used for fajitas.</p>
